![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green.svg) ![Platform](https://img.shields.io/badge/Platform-SD%20WebUI%20Forge-blue.svg) ![Cost](https://img.shields.io/badge/Cost-%240.01%2Fupscale-yellow.svg)

A dedicated extension for **Stable Diffusion WebUI Forge** that integrates the Wavespeed AI (https://wavespeed.ai) **SeedVR2 Upscaler**. This tool allows you to seamlessly upscale your generated images to **2k, 4k, or 8k** resolution directly within the Forge interface for just **$0.01 USD per upscale**.

It features a streamlined workflow with "Grab Last Generated" functionality, a built-in aspect ratio corrector (center crop), and a **0.35 Megapixel optimizer** to ensure the highest possible texture quality from the SeedVR2 model.

## 🚀 Features

* **Ultra-Low Cost**: Professional grade upscaling for only **$0.01 USD per image**.
* **High-Fidelity Results**: Leverage SeedVR2 to upscale images to **2k, 4k, or 8k**.
* **0.35MP Optimization**: New **"Downscale to 0.35MP"** toggle. This pre-processes images to the model's "sweet spot," preventing waxy textures and maximizing skin/surface detail.
* **Format Flexibility**: Export results as **PNG, JPEG, or WEBP**.
* **Workflow Integration**: Instantly load the most recent image from your `txt2img` or `img2img` output folders with a single click.
* **Aspect Ratio Fixer**: Optional **Center Crop** tool to correct resolutions (e.g., removing the extra 8 pixels often generated by SDXL/SD1.5 due to latent space rounding).
* **Auto-Save**: All upscaled results are automatically saved to your Forge `outputs/extras-images` folder.
* **Secure Config**: Store your API key permanently in the Forge Settings or enter it per session.

## 🖥️ Usage Guide

1. **Open the Tab**: Click on the **Wavespeed AI** tab in the main Forge interface.
2. **Select Input Source**:
   * **Local / Upload**: Drag and drop an image, or click **"📅 Grab Last Generated Image"** to auto-load your latest generation.
   * **URL**: Switch to the "Image URL" tab to upscale a remote image link.
3. **Adjust Pre-Processing**:
   * **Downscale to 0.35MP**: (Recommended) Keep this checked for the best SeedVR2 results. It cleans the image and lets the AI reconstruct details from a clean base.
   * **Pre-Upscale Crop**: (Optional) Check "Enable Center Crop" to trim edges (e.g., 1920x1088 to 1080) before processing.
4. **Select Target**: Choose **2k, 4k, or 8k** and your preferred format.
5. **Upscale**: Click the **Upscale** button ($0.01 per transaction).
6. **View Results**: The processed image will appear in the result window and be saved to your output directory.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

**"Why should I use the 0.35MP option?"**
> SeedVR2 is a "tiled" diffusion upscaler. If you feed it a very high-res but slightly blurry image, it can sometimes produce "waxy" skin. Downscaling to 0.35MP first forces the model to re-generate those details, resulting in much sharper pores, hair, and textures.

**"Error: Please enter your API Key..."**
> Ensure you have pasted your key in the Settings tab or the text box on the page.

**"Submission Error..."**
> Check your internet connection, verify your API key is valid, and ensure you have sufficient credits on your Wavespeed account.
