# Wavespeed AI - SeedVR2 Upscaler for Forge

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green.svg) ![Platform](https://img.shields.io/badge/Platform-SD%20WebUI%20Forge-blue.svg) ![Cost](https://img.shields.io/badge/Cost-%240.01%2Fupscale-yellow.svg)

A dedicated extension for **Stable Diffusion WebUI Forge** that integrates the Wavespeed AI (https://wavespeed.ai) **SeedVR2 Upscaler**. This tool allows you to seamlessly upscale your generated images to **2k, 4k, or 8k** resolution directly within the Forge interface for just **$0.01 USD per upscale**.

It features a streamlined workflow with "Grab Last Generated" functionality and a built-in aspect ratio corrector (center crop) to fix non-standard resolutions (e.g., trimming 1920x1088 to 1920x1080) prior to upscaling.

* **Format Flexibility**: Export results as **PNG, JPEG, or WEBP**.
* **Workflow Integration**: Instantly load the most recent image from your `txt2img` or `img2img` output folders with a single click.

3. Paste your key into the **Wavespeed API Key** field.
